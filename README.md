## CHAOS GAME REPRESENTATION FOR SEQUENCE SIMILARITY ANALYSIS

#### There are two main parts to the project - Analysis of sequences using Frequency CGR (FCGR) and Coordinate CGR.

## Methods implemented

###### Note: While plotting, the y-axis is inverted to follow the usual convention.

### Frequency CGR



### Coordinate CGR


Annotated code of our project has been provided.  We also used streamlit open-source app framework for creating a custom web-app for our project. A folder with the source code for the app, snips of the expected output and directions for running it have also been provided. 

## Data

The data has been gathered from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/). We tried for two categories of data - hCov-19 and BetaCov-19 sequences (DNA_SEQ folder) and also for human and various animal genome sequences (ANIMAL_GENOME folder).

## Additional Note

In the code, the CGR of the sequences being analyzed are exported as png files in the same folder as the data. So in the same folders as the data, we have uploaded the images for a sample execution as well.
